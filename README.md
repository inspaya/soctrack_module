## Gauging the mood of people in a given area based on conversations they are having

Using data from Twitter, we create a machine-learning model to gauge sentiments of people and use 
the data obtained to visualize the general mood of society in that pre-defined geographical zone.

Similar to how we built the eNaira demo website, https://enaira.istemlabsafrica.site/

## Competition Category

Data Visualization - Let data tell a unique story. Help make decisions and improve overall operational efficiencies by displaying data on your map. 

## The Output

We will be using custom markers to indicate peoples moods, and based on that, using polylines/polygons 
to suggest that people in a given area are happy/sad. 

The product site is available at https://ask.ngmap.live/
